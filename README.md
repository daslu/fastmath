## Documentation

[HERE](https://generateme.github.io/fastmath/index.html)

## Content

* [PrimitiveMath](https://github.com/ztellman/primitive-math) - Zach Tellmeans' code enhanced
* [FastMath](https://github.com/jeffhain/jafama) bindings
* Processing like math functions
* Vector operations protocol form:
  * 2d (`Vec2`), 3d (`Vec3`) and 4d (`Vec4`) vector types.
  * ArrayVector for fixed length long vectors
  * Clojure vector []
* Complex number functions
* Random numbers, sequences
* Various noises (value, gradient, simplex, discrete)
* [Statistics](https://gist.github.com/scottdw/2960070) - by Scott Douglas-Watson
* Plenty of constant values

Almost all functions optimized to work on `double` and `long` primitives
